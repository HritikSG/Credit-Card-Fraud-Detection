# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Detecting Credit card fraud transactions using data mining and ML techniques 

This project is developed as part of the ECE 537 Data Mining course and aims to tackle the problem of credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. The main objective is to effectively detect fraudulent transactions within a dataset containing 1.3 million financial transactions.

Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a growing concern due to the increase in online transactions. We address this issue by employing data exploration and machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to identify fraudulent activities in a significantly imbalanced dataset from Kaggle.

Methodology
The approach includes thorough Exploratory Data Analysis using visualization tools to uncover patterns and relationships in the data. We assessed three different models on their ability to handle imbalanced data, with XGBoost providing the most effective results.

Results
The models were evaluated based on ROC/AUC, precision, recall, and accuracy:

Logistic Regression showed promising results but was outperformed by XGBoost.
Random Forest demonstrated lower performance compared to the others.
XGBoost achieved the highest scores across all metrics, making it the preferred model due to its robustness in handling data imbalance and complexity.
Conclusion
This project highlights the effectiveness of machine learning in detecting credit card fraud. The findings emphasize the importance of careful model selection and the use of advanced techniques to deal with challenges such as class imbalance and feature complexity.
